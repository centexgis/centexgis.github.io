## About

The CenTex GIS website is built using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) static site generator. The theme is based on a fork of the SOLID Jekyll theme. The site is hosted directly from this GitHub repo and includes a CNAME file in the root directory for the custom domain [centexgis.com](http://centexgis.com).
