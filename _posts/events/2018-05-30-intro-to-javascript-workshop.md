CenTex GIS and ATX GIS Day proudly present an Introductory JavaScript workshop! Have you ever wanted to know how to develop a web map using JavaScript? Here's the perfect workshop for novice/beginner participants with little or no programming experience. The class will cover basic programming concepts and syntax as we make a simple web map using the ESRI JavaScript API.

It will include two 2 hour lectures broken down into small sessions/exercises and a walk through of serving your application at the end of the workshop. The class will be taught by local GIS developer professional, Aubrey Drescher.

Students will be required to bring their own laptop with the following software downloaded and installed prior to the workshop:
- Adobe Brackets (http://brackets.io) open-source text editor
- Google Chrome (https://google.com/chrome) web browser
